                                Release History

   This page summarizes the changes between official stable releases of Go.
   The change log has the full details.

Release Policy

   Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major
   releases. For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and
   Go 1.6 was supported until the Go 1.8 release. We fix critical problems,
   including critical security problems, in supported releases as needed by
   issuing minor revisions (for example, Go 1.6.1, Go 1.6.2, and so on).
