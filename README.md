> What's new (since Go [1.14](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.14))?

Talk at [Leipzig Software Craft Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/LE-software-craft-community/), date and time: TBD.

## Outline

* Go modules
* Generics
* Embedding
* ...

## TODO(martin)

* try to use [git-of-theseus](https://github.com/erikbern/git-of-theseus) on go repo
* word cloud of word in release notes, maybe

## TODO(andreas)

* Beginning from which version should we define Go as _legacy Go_?
  - Go 1.14 might be a reasonable choice, because it's the first one that made modules the default.
* List changes in the behavior of `go`, e.g. `go get` and `go install`
