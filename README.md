# State of Go in 2022

> What's new (since Go [1.14](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.14))?

Talk at [Leipzig Software Craft Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/LE-software-craft-community/), date and time: TBD.

## Outline

> max 45 minutes (?)

* Go modules (10)
* Generics (10)
* Embedding (as part of stdlib changes) (5)
* Tools (e.g. fuzzing) (5)
* Use cases, users, ecosystem (e.g. adoption, popularity, mainstream popularity, [hacker-howto](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html), ... (15)

## TODO(martin)

* [x] try to use [git-of-theseus](https://github.com/erikbern/git-of-theseus) on go repo
* [ ] find some numbers on adoption and bigger corporate users

## TODO(andreas)

* Beginning from which version should we define Go as _legacy Go_?
  - Go 1.14 might be a reasonable choice, because it's the first one that made modules the default.
* List changes in the behavior of `go`, e.g. `go get` and `go install`
