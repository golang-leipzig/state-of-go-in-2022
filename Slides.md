## Change to the language

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/golang/website.git
$ grep -l "There are no.*changes to the language." website/_content/doc/go1.1*html
_content/doc/go1.10.html
_content/doc/go1.11.html
_content/doc/go1.12.html
_content/doc/go1.15.html
_content/doc/go1.16.html
```

5 out of the 9 past releases (Go 1.10, 2018-02-16 to 1.18, 2022-03-15) do not
contain *any ... changes* to the language.

The single biggest change to the language is the addition of [generic
types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming) in Go 1.18. All other
changes have been small enhancements (like number literals, changes in
`unsafe`, ...). Some say, we already have [Go 2](https://xeiaso.net/blog/we-have-go-2).

## So, what changed?

We want to highlight a few changes and how they affect everyday Go development:

* move to **Go modules** for dependency management
* introduction of **generic types**
* **standard library** additions: [`hash/maphash`](https://pkg.go.dev/hash/maphash) (1.14), [`testing/Cleanup`](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Cleanup), [`time/tzdata`](https://pkg.go.dev/time/tzdata) (1.15), [`embed`](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) (1.16), [`testing/SetEnv`](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Cleanup), [`debug/buildinfo`](https://pkg.go.dev/debug/buildinfo) (1.18), [`net/netip`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/netip) (1.18)
* **tools** evolution (e.g. fuzz testing)

As well as use cases, users and **ecosystem** changes.

## Generics

Or: [parametric polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism)

Relevant proposal:

* [43651](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md) (2021, accepted)

Previous discussion:

> Go should support some form of generic programming.
Generic programming enables the representation of algorithms and data
structures in a generic form, with concrete elements of the code (such as
types) factored out. It means the ability to express algorithms with minimal
assumptions about data structures, and vice-versa.

[...]

> Generics permit type-safe polymorphic containers. Go currently has a very
> limited set of such containers: slices, and maps of most but not all types.
> Not every program can be written using a slice or map.

> Look at the functions SortInts, SortFloats, SortStrings in the sort package.
> Or SearchInts, SearchFloats, SearchStrings. Or the Len, Less, and Swap
> methods of byName in package io/ioutil. **Pure boilerplate copying**.

Who wrote that? [...] [Proposal: Go should have generics](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/15292-generics.md) (2011)

A few more:

> As Russ pointed out, **generics are a trade off between programmer time, compilation time, and execution time.**

### Key Ideas

* Functions and types can have **type parameters**, which are defined using **constraints**, which are **interface types**.
* Constraints describe the **methods required** and the **types permitted** for a type argument.
* Constraints describe the methods and operations permitted for a type parameter.
* **Type inference** will often permit omitting type arguments when calling functions with type parameters.

> This design is completely backward compatible.

There are many things Go Generics do not support: No metaprogramming (macros);
no operator methods (e.g. no syntax like `c[i]` for custom types); no
[covariance or contravariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)) of function parameters; ...


### Notable changes

* `any` (alias for `interface{}`, [operations
permitted](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md#operations-permitted-for-any-type))
and `comparable` as [predeclared
identifiers](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Predeclared_identifiers)
* a new [contraints](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/constraints) package,
not in the standard library yet (but in
[exp](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp#section-readme), *In short, code in
this subrepository is not subject to the Go 1 compatibility promise.*)

### Examples

#### Basic

* [https://go.dev/play/p/MM38gRuTRKB](https://go.dev/play/p/MM38gRuTRKB)

```go
// Dummy example, showing contraints as interface type and type parameters.

type Number interface {
    int | int64 | float64
}

func Min[Number T](u, v T) T {
    if u < v {
        return u
    }
    return v
}
```

#### Constraints and Methods

* [https://go.dev/play/p/HsJtEJnzJdl](https://go.dev/play/p/HsJtEJnzJdl)

```go
// You can edit this code!
// Click here and start typing.
package main

import "fmt"

type Number interface {
	~int | ~int64 | ~float64
	String() string
}

func Min[T Number](u, v T) T {
	if u < v {
		return u
	}
	return v
}

type MyInt int

func (i MyInt) String() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("[%d]", i)
}

func main() {
	r := Min(MyInt(3), MyInt(4))
	fmt.Printf("%v %T", r, r)
	// 3 int
}
```

#### Set

```go
// Package sets implements sets of any comparable type.
package sets

// Set is a set of values.
type Set[T comparable] map[T]struct{}

// Make returns a set of some element type.
func Make[T comparable]() Set[T] {
    return make(Set[T])
}

// Add adds v to the set s.
// If v is already in s this has no effect.
func (s Set[T]) Add(v T) {
    s[v] = struct{}{}
}

// Delete removes v from the set s.
// If v is not in s this has no effect.
func (s Set[T]) Delete(v T) {
    delete(s, v)
}

// Contains reports whether v is in s.
func (s Set[T]) Contains(v T) bool {
    _, ok := s[v]
    return ok
}
```

#### Dot Product

```go
// Numeric is a constraint that matches any numeric type.
// It would likely be in a constraints package in the standard library.
type Numeric interface {
    ~int | ~int8 | ~int16 | ~int32 | ~int64 |
        ~uint | ~uint8 | ~uint16 | ~uint32 | ~uint64 | ~uintptr |
        ~float32 | ~float64 |
        ~complex64 | ~complex128
}

// DotProduct returns the dot product of two slices.
// This panics if the two slices are not the same length.
func DotProduct[T Numeric](s1, s2 []T) T {
    if len(s1) != len(s2) {
        panic("DotProduct: slices of unequal length")
    }
    var r T
    for i := range s1 {
        r += s1[i] * s2[i]
    }
    return r
}
```

### Summary

...


### Testing

Testing hasn't changed much, except the addition of fuzz testing.
But, some utility methods were added to the already great standard library testing library.
Below is an example that uses `t.Cleanup` as well as `t.SetEnv` which were added with Go 1.14 and 1.17:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"testing"
)

func TestDemonstrateAdditions(t *testing.T) {
	err := os.WriteFile("./test.json", []byte(`{"foo": "bar"}`), 0o600)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err.Error())
	}
	// Cleanup will be called when test finishes, i.e. if it has failed or succeeded.
	defer t.Cleanup(func() {
		t.Log("called")
		os.Remove("./test.json")
	})

	// This will be unset automatically after test finishes.
	t.Setenv("USERNAME", "andreas")
	
	// ...
}

```

## Popular libraries and Frameworks

Following is a list of popular frameworks and libraries, which you can take as a reference.  Of course, the most popular package is not always the best choice, but often a reliable one.
Our method for determining what the most popular frameworks and libraries are, is to simply sort them by GitHub stars.  Go's [package search](https://pkg.go.dev/search) does not allow to sort by number of imports.

Most popular:

- web framework is [`gin`](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- HTTP client is [`resty`](https://github.com/go-resty/resty)
- HTTP router is [`gorilla/mux`](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
- microservice framework is [`kit`](https://github.com/go-kit/kit)
- testing library is [`testify`](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- object relational mapper is [`gorm`](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm)
- logging library is [`logrus`](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)

This list is probably no surprise for most longer term Go developers, since those packages exist since quite some time and their popularity hasn't changed much.

But, please be aware that you can come a long way without needing any dependencies just using Go's standard library!
Also, if you need to choose a dependency make sure that it's somehow compatible with standard libraries interface's (e.g. the ubiquitous `http.Handler` or `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`).
Onboarding new developers will be much easier then, since they don't have to learn new paradigms just to do the same thing.
Also, it will help when needing to replace a dependency, since a bit compatibility is ensured.

## Packaging

Go started with a very opinionated design choice on how to organize your code, the `$GOPATH`.
A typical `GOPATH` looked like this:

```
~/go
   /bin # executables installed via go get (now go install)
   /pkg # pre-compiled libraries
   /src
      /company.com/a/project # a personal project
         /.git/
         /main.go
         /vendor/ # contains vendored/copied dependencies
         /...
      /github.com/dependency/x # dependencies
      /github.com/dependency/y
```

Developers could not use their typical `~/code` folder (or similar) to setup a Go project, instead they needed to work inside `$GOPATH/src/<project>`, which is pretty inconvenient.  There were some workarounds around this limitation, e.g. setting up repo specific GOPATH's, but this often broke tooling.
The biggest limitation of this code organization was that you could only use one version of any dependency at a time, even across projects.
Except dependencies were vendored, with the downside of then having huge git repositories.
At Google this wasn't a problem since everything was stored in a big monorepo anyways, but most companies didn't work with this code organization setup.

A bunch of tools were developed by the community to workaround the dependency problem, with `dep` being the most popular one.
However, the Go team decided to work on their own concept which would then become _Go Modules_.  Modules can be used with the `go` tool and didn't require any third-party dependency but in the beginning they were not enabled by default.
Still, adoption of Go Modules was already very high in 2019 as the following chart from [2019's developer survey results](https://go.dev/blog/survey2019-results) shows:

![Adoption of Go Modules in 2019](https://go.dev/blog/survey2019/fig22.svg)

With Go 1.14, released on 25th of February 2020, Modules became the default.
Ultimately, this shows how much need there was for a fast and easy to use packaging solution.

Since then the `GOPATH` is nothing to care about anymore, instead a new Go project can be setup in any folder using the following commands:

```sh
$ mkdir myproject && cd myproject
$ go mod init myproject
```

There's also a official Go on [how to write Go code](https://go.dev/doc/code) that explains a project setup in more detail.

Not only did Modules made development more convenient, they also helped to ensure reproducibility and authenticity of dependencies.  The `go` command verifies a cryptographic hash of each (public) direct and indirect dependency against a global hash sum database to ensure their authenticity.  Those checksums are what's stored inside a Modules [`go.sum` file](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-sum-files).

## Embed

Deployment and distribution was always one of the strong points of Go since it can be easily (cross-) compiled into a statically linked binary that is then shipped.
With the [`embed` package](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) there is now a standard way of bundling any number of files or directories into a binary.
A webserver for example can be shipped as a single binary including all its assets, templates, Javascript files and so on.
Another common usecase is to bundle SQL migration files.
Embedding something is very easy, all it takes to embed a directory is this:

```go
//go:embed assets
var assets embed.FS
```

Files can be directly embedded as `[]byte` or `string`.
