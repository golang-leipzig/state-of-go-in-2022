## Change to the language

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/golang/website.git
$ grep -l "There are no.*changes to the language." website/_content/doc/go1.1*html
_content/doc/go1.10.html
_content/doc/go1.11.html
_content/doc/go1.12.html
_content/doc/go1.15.html
_content/doc/go1.16.html
```

5 out of the 9 past releases (Go 1.10, 2018-02-16 to 1.18, 2022-03-15) do not
contain any changes to the language.

The single biggest change to the language is the addition of generic types in
Go 1.18. All other changes have been small enhancements (like number literals,
changes in `unsafe`, ...).

## So, what changed?

We want to highlight a few changes and how they affect everyday Go development:

* move to **Go modules** for dependency management
* introduction of **generic types**
* **standard library** additions: `hash/maphash` (1.14), `time/tzdata` (1.15), `embed` (1.16), `debug/buildinfo` (1.18), `net/netip` (1.18)
* **tools** evolution (e.g. fuzz testing)

Use cases, users, ecosystem.
